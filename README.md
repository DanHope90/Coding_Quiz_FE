# :question: Dev Quiz -  Manchester Codes Final Project - Dan Hope/Chris Peakin - Oct 2021 Cohort :question:

## Introduction

Welcome to Dev Quiz! 

Dev Quiz is a simple web application designed to test basic knowledge of programming.

## Use

In Dev Quiz, you can take quizzes on programming languages and concepts.

If you register and login, you can save these quizzes to your user account and view your previous scores.

You don't have to be logged in to simple take a quiz, but you do in order to save your scores.

## Dev Installation

To view the code inside, simply clone the repository and run `npm i` to install the relevant dependencies. The App will render using `localhost:3000`.

You can also run `npm test` to run the tests.

## Further Work

With extra time, we were going to work on a leaderboard. The leaderboard would have allowed the user to view the other users' scores on a particular quiz. The user will not necessarily have to have been logged in to do this.

A few bugs emerged when trying to render saved quizzes, so sorting those out would've been something to try.

Authentication via Facebook and "dark mode" media queries on the CSS styling may also be further things to look into with extra time.
